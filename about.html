			<h2>About</h2>
			<p class="small-text">My name is Isabella and this is my portfolio. As a dedicated Information Technology college student, I have honed my skills in both web development and graphic design. My passion for technology has driven me to explore various aspects of the field, and I have consistently sought out opportunities to expand my knowledge and experience.

                In my web development studies, I have gained extensive knowledge of modern front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I have also developed proficiency in using popular web development frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js. My graphic design skills, combined with my web development experience, have allowed me to create visually appealing and user-friendly web applications.
                
                In addition to web development and graphic design, I have a strong interest in the field of AI and machine learning. I have been actively involved in research related to adversarial robustness, which involves designing AI systems that are robust to adversarial attacks. I have co-authored a paper on this topic that has been submitted to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and is currently under review. The paper presents a novel approach to adversarial robustness that leverages reinforcement learning techniques and achieves improved performance compared to existing methods.
                
                I also have a strong interest in the field of cybersecurity, and I am fascinated by the interplay between technology and society. I believe that understanding the human aspect of technology is essential for developing secure and user-friendly systems. This has led me to study human computer interaction (HCI), which involves understanding how people interact with technology and designing systems that meet their needs and expectations.
                
                In conclusion, I am a highly motivated Information Technology college student with a passion for technology. My web development and graphic design experience, combined with my research in AI and machine learning and my interest in cybersecurity and HCI, make me a well-rounded individual with a broad range of skills and knowledge. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world projects and continue to grow as a professional in this exciting field.</p>
